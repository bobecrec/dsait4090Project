Bresson's screenplay is drawn from the transcriptions of Joan's trial and rehabilitation. Bresson's \"Joan of Arc\" is often compared with \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928) by Carl Theodor Dreyer. Bresson compared that film unfavorably with his own, expressing his dislike of the actors' \"grotesque buffooneries\" in Dreyer's film.",

Scientists using DNA samples from Queen Anne of Romania, and her brother Andre de Bourbon- Parme, maternal relatives of Louis XVII, and from a strand of Marie- Antoinette's hair, proved the young royal's identity. Historic evidence as to the location of the heart over the decades was also considered.

The film was produced by Anand Kumar under the banner of Yes Cinema and it was mainly shot in Nelliyampathi, Ottappalam and Shoranur in Kerala. \" Bhoomiyude Avakashikal\" is the third and last installment of T. V. Chandran's trilogy on 2002 Gujarat riots. The first one was,\" Kathavasheshan\"( 2004), it was followed by\" Vilapangalkkappuram\"( 2008). The narratives of all these films begin on the same day, 28 February 2002, that is, on the day after the Godhra train burning in Gujarat. \" Bhoomiyude Avakashikal\" tells the story of Mohanachandran Nair, who is driven away from Ahmadabad following the Gujarat riots and who eventually loses his job and even his identity and ultimately lands up in a secluded house in Kerala, in the company of insects and animals with whom he shares his thoughts, concerns, doubts and frustrations. The film was shot digitally to reduce costs as it was required to film several insects and animals in their natural habitat. The film premiered at the 43rd International Film Festival of India on 27 November 2012. It was also an official selection for the International Film Festival of Kerala.",

In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.",

Debruge continued: Watching\" The Wait\", there can be little doubt that this first- time helmer has the potential to become one of Italy's most prominent new voices( the signs were there as early as his Cannes- selected 2011 student film,\" Terra\", another abstractly stylized exercise in psychological identification featuring Colangeli). From Sorrentino, Messina has further developed his ability to deliver a stunning sensory experience, though the treatment feels inadequate for such lean material. If anything, his aesthetic choices are too impressive, calling attention to themselves, rather than discreetly enabling the appropriate emotional reaction.",

In 1353 he married Margaret Sinclair, a daughter of William de St Clair of Rosslyn. (St Clair was slain in 1330, along with Sir James Douglas, at the Battle of Teba whilst accompanying King Robert's Heart to the Holy Land.) The petition for this marriage was sent to the Holy See, with support from John II of France, which would suggest that the young Angus spent time at the French court. Present at the siege of Berwick in 1355, Angus was one of the lords that negotiated the release of David II following his 10-year captivity following the Battle of Neville's Cross. At some point in the late 1350s, Stewart was made Great Chamberlain of Scotland, an office he lost at some point before 1359, when Walter de Biggar was in office. Angus was considered one of the conspirators in the murder of King David's mistress, Catherine Mortimer, at Soutra in 1360, and was duly imprisoned.

On October 25, at the Future Investment Summit in Riyadh, the robot was granted Saudi Arabian citizenship, becoming the first robot ever to have a nationality. This attracted controversy as some commentators wondered if this implied that Sophia could vote or marry, or whether a deliberate system shutdown could be considered murder. Social media users used Sophia's citizenship to criticize Saudi Arabia's human rights record. As explained by Ali Al - Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, ``Women (in Saudi Arabia) have since committed suicide because they could n't leave the house, and Sophia is running around (without a male guardian). Saudi law does n't allow non-Muslims to get citizenship. Did Sophia convert to Islam? What is the religion of this Sophia and why is n't she wearing hijab? If she applied for citizenship as a human she would n't get it. ''In December 2017, Sophia's creator David Hanson said in an interview that Sophia will use her citizenship to advocate for women's rights in her now country of citizenship; Newsweek criticized that`` What (Hanson) means, exactly, is unclear ''..",

For example, the pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the dark-eyed junco Junco hyemalis migrates from subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American goldfinch from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents. Some ducks, such as the garganey Anas querquedula, move completely or partially into the tropics. The European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.",

There is controversy about whether he is Francesco's son, since the Oxford Index states Alessandro's birth year as 1660, while Francesco died in 1630.

Agnes' brother, Sir Philip Tilney of Shelley (d.1533), was the paternal grandfather of Edmund Tilney (1535/6\u20131610), Master of the Revels to Queen Elizabeth and King James. Edmund Tilney's mother, Malyn, was implicated in the scandal surrounding Queen Catherine's downfall.",

One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf \"Sarffgadau\" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.",
