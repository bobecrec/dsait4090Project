Neni\u021bescu and his wife Elena (\"n\u00e9e\" \u0218tefan). He attended Sapienza University of Rome from 1920, as well as the literature and philosophy department of Bucharest University. At first an assistant professor of aesthetics, he later became an associate professor at Bucharest. He served as press secretary and later economic adviser to the Romanian legation in The Hague. Neni\u021bescu's first publication was a 1915 article about William Shakespeare that appeared in \"Noua revist\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103\". His first book of poetry, \"Denii\" (1919), was followed by \"Vraj\u0103\" (1923) and \"Ode italice\" (1925). His single volume of theatre was \"Trei mistere\" (1922). From 1924, he wrote for \"G\u00e2ndirea\", and was a founding member of Romania's PEN Club. He also contributed poetry and art criticism to \"Convorbiri LiterareIdeea european\u0103VremeaUniversul literarVia\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103Adev\u0103rul\" and \"Arta plastic\u0103\". In 1925, Neni\u021bescu published a treatise, \"Istoria artei ca filosofie a istoriei\". He translated from Benedetto Croce (\"Aesthetic\", 1922) and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (\"The Mandrake\", 1926). Initially, Neni\u021bescu's poetry was discursive and religious, in line with the \"G\u00e2ndirist\" current. His verse became progressively more hermetic, as can be seen in the anthology volume \"Ani\" (1973). Including texts published in the 1940s and '50s, it reveals the intellectualized lyric verse of an eminently classical nature.",

Tulard was one of the experts involved in verifying the heart believed to be that of Louis XVII of France, actually the Dauphin of France as the heir apparent to the throne, who died in 1795 in imprisonment. Scientists using DNA samples from Queen Anne of Romania, and her brother Andre de Bourbon- Parme, maternal relatives of Louis XVII, and from a strand of Marie- Antoinette's hair, proved the young royal's identity. Historic evidence as to the location of the heart over the decades was also considered. In a summary of the investigation in 2004, Tulard wrote:\" This heart is ... almost certainly that of Louis XVII. We can never be 100 per cent sure but this is about as sure as it gets\".

One Gwenc'hlan or Guinclaff around 1450 wrote a\" chant royal\", or\" Dialogue between King Arthur and Gwenc'hlan\", quoted by Dom Le Pelletier and Gregory of Rostrenen. The poem was rediscovered in 1924. The Breton used by this Gwenc'hlan is already deeply pervaded by French. The legend of the 6th century bard is largely a creation of de la Villemarqu\u00e9's, but he may have based his account on the 15th century author, as well as on other traditional Breton tales. He quotes 6th to 12th century Welsh poems attributed to the bards Aneurin, Taliesin and Llywarch Hen as his sources.",

He emigrated to Israel at the age of 20 and lived on a kibbutz, then moved to France and opened a translation bureau. In the 1990s he was awarded the French \"Ordre national du M\u00e9rite\" and the \"Ordre du M\u00e9rite agricole\" for actions taken to rescue personnel in the War in Bosnia. In the AngolaGate scandal, he was convicted of failure to declare income. On November 24, 2015, he started serving a prison sentence at Fresnes prison in France for that tax issue. In the early 21st century, Gaydamak returned to Israel, where he founded Social Justice, a movement that became a political party. He ran for mayor of Jerusalem but did not win. He bought Hapoel Jerusalem, a professional basketball club. He also bought two newspapers, one in France and one in Russia. He directed the latter to take a pro-government/Vladimir Putin editorial stance. In Israel he has been a generous philanthropist.",

In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandari\u0107. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandari\u0107 remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be \u00a332,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent \u00a32.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.",

Leonora was born in Florence, where she was brought up by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Eleanor of Toledo, her aunt and namesake. Betrothed to their son Pietro at the age of 15, she blossomed under the wing of Pietro's older sister, the artistic patron Isabella, into a vivacious and witty beauty. Her marriage, like Isabella's, was not a success, and she followed her mentor's example of taking lovers. For this reason, Pietro had her brought in 1576 to the country retreat of Cafaggiolo, where he strangled her to death with a dog leash. Cosimo's successor, Francesco I, tacitly approved the murder, and Pietro was never brought to justice for it. Until recently, little was known of Leonora di Garzia di Toledo, and she was not identified as the sitter of several portraits of her. The facts of her life have emerged from the growing scholarship on Isabella de' Medici, with whom she has much in common. In the view of art historian Gabrielle Langdon, \"Her story is valuable in revealing attitudes and legalities attendant on the lives and decorum of women in the early-modern Italian court\".",

This attracted controversy as some commentators wondered if this implied that Sophia could vote or marry, or whether a deliberate system shutdown could be considered murder. Social media users used Sophia's citizenship to criticize Saudi Arabia's human rights record.

If she applied for citizenship as a human she would n't get it.

The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said \"\"Goli Soda\" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema\". Sify called it \"a gutsy and outstanding film\" and continued, \"The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity\". Cinemalead.com rated it with 4/5 stars and said \"Overall if you prefer to watch a gutsy film which is different and unique from the routine Tamil cinema, go and watch Goli Soda which surely deserves a repeated viewing\".",

One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf \"Sarffgadau\" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.",
